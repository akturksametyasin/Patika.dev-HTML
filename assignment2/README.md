## Instructions

**Continuing to Detail Our Personal Page**

In our previous assignment, we made our first web page and designed it as our personal page. Let's continue to improve this page within the framework of the new information we have learned.

* Add an image to your page and write a description for it.
* List your favorite movies, TV series and books as titles. (Movie, series, book ordered list, bullet list content)
* When listing them, write an IMDb link for at least one of the movies and TV series and a Goodreads link for one of the books.
* Try to use elements such as block and inline in the structures you set up.

The page you made can be in a structure like the one above. In this assignment, we saw how we use HTML elements, how we create a structure.
